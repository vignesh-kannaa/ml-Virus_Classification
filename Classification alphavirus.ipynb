    "Outliers in data can impact by skewing the distribution of the data, increasing the variability of the data, and reducing the accuracy of statistical analyses and machine learning models. Outliers can also affect the interpretability of the data, making it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions and insights from the data. Therefore, it is important to detect and handle outliers appropriately.\n",

However, when dealing with high-dimensional datasets with 1000+ dimensions, additional methods such as examining variable skewness, assessing numerical feature scales, and using t-SNE for graphical analysis may also be useful in identifying outliers."

    "To avoid data leakage, it's recommended to split the training data into smaller subsets and use them sequentially for different stages of development. For instance, one subset can be used for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and deciding pre-processing steps, while another subset can be used for model development. The third subset can be kept aside for final performance assessment, thereby preventing any bias from occurring due to repeated usage of the same data.\n",

This means that observations with the same Info_cluster value should always be kept together when splitting the data, as they may be more similar to each other than to other observations in the dataset."

    "After conducting a thorough data mining process, we have gained valuable insights into the dataset. We have learned about the distribution of the data, the presence of missing values, and the relationships between variables. Through feature selection techniques and model optimization, we have identified the most important variables and built a predictive model that performs well on both the training and test datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, our analysis of the dataset revealed that there may be an optimal balance between using training data from viruses that are more similar to the target virus (level 2) and using data from viruses that are more dissimilar (level 3). We found that training the model on a small amount of data from similar viruses may result in better performance on the target virus due to the similarities between the viruses. However, training the model on a larger volume of data from diverse viruses can provide a broader understanding of the virus family and help the model learn more generalizable features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we discovered that the level 2 dataset had biased data that required undersampling, while the level 3 dataset had more or less equal data and did not require undersampling. Both datasets had missing data and few outliers that were handled during preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We performed model selection and found that both models performed well. To further enhance the model's performance, we could fine-tune hyperparameters or explore alternative models. However, it is crucial to consider other factors such as the size and diversity of the training data, as well as the complexity of the model, to obtain a more comprehensive assessment of its performance."
