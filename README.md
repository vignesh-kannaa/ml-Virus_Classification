Virus classification using machine learning models
### Abstract
Linear B-cell epitopes are short protein fragments that are recognized by certain components of the immune system, and their identification is often an important early step in the development of vaccines, diagnostic tests and therapeutic interventions against infectious diseases, allergies and even some cancers

we will explore a dataset that is directly related to this problem. We will be exploring epitope data and trying to predict epitopes for Alphavirus, a genus of mosquito-borne viruses that includes pathogens of medical concert such as Chikungunya and other viruses that affect millions of people

### Introduction
There are five different training data sets, including increasingly more data from more distant relatives of the Alphavirus genus. We are going to explore the first and second dataset. Our goal is to develop an efficient data mining pipeline to (potentially) predict new, previously unknown epitopes in viruses from this genus.

Besides the data sets available for training, there is a validation data file(df_holdout.csv). This file has the same structure as the training data without Class attribute. It is part of our task to develop a competent data mining pipeline capable of predicting it!

### Model Summary
Data collection and understanding:
Obtain the data from the source and understand its format, structure, and meaning.

#### Data cleaning:
Clean the data by identifying and handling missing or erroneous values, removing duplicates, and handling outliers.

#### Data exploration:
Explore the data using descriptive statistics, visualization, and other exploratory data analysis techniques to gain insights into the data and identify patterns.

#### Feature engineering:
Transform the data by creating new features, combining existing features, or removing irrelevant features.

#### Data scaling and normalization:
Scale the data to a common range to ensure that all features are equally important and prevent any single feature from dominating the model.

#### Data balancing:
Address any class imbalance issues in the data, which can be done through over-sampling or under-sampling techniques.

#### Dimensionality reduction:
Reduce the number of features in the data to avoid overfitting and improve model performance.

#### Splitting data into training /validation / test sets:
Split the data into training, validation and test sets to evaluate the performance of the model.

#### Model selection:
Select the appropriate machine learning algorithm(s) for the problem at hand, based on the type of data, the size of the dataset, and the desired output.

#### Model training:
Train the model using the training data and evaluate its performance using the test data.

#### Model prediction:
Use the trained model to predict outcomes on new, unseen data.

#### Hyperparameter tuning:
Fine-tune the model by adjusting the hyperparameters to optimize its performance. This can be done using techniques such as grid search or random search.

#### Model evaluation:
Evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curve.

#### Pipeline creation:
Create a pipeline that combines all the steps in the data preprocessing and model training process, making it easier to apply the same preprocessing steps and model to new data(holdout dataset).
